# @isaque777/metallandmodel

A collection of reusable TypeScript model classes and interfaces for use in Angular and TypeScript projects.  
This module provides strongly-typed representations for common entities such as users, addresses, albums, bands, real estate, and more.  
It is designed to help you standardize and accelerate model development in your applications.

### **1. Test Locally**
#### **Link your package for local testing**
```bash
npm link          # Creates a global symlink to your package
```
- Test in another AngularJS project:
  ```bash
  npm link @isaque777/metallandmodel
  ```
  ```javascript
  // In your AngularJS app
  angular.module('myApp', ['@isaque777/metallandmodel'])
    .controller('MyCtrl', function($scope, models) {
      // Use models here
      $scope.models = models;
    });
  ```

### **2. Publish to npm**
#### **Create an npm account**
1. Sign up at [npmjs.com/signup](https://www.npmjs.com/signup).
2. Verify your email.

#### **Log in via CLI**
```bash
npm login         # Follow prompts for username/password/email
```

#### **Publish**
```bash
npm publish      # Publishes to npm (publicly, if package is free)
```
- For a **scoped package** (e.g., `@username/my-package`):
  ```bash
  npm publish --access public  # Required for free scoped packages
  ```

---

### **3. Update Your Package**
1. Bump the version in `package.json` (or use `npm version`):
   ```bash
   npm version patch  # Updates to v1.0.1 (or `minor`/`major`)
   ```
2. Republish:
   ```bash
   npm publish
   ```

---

### **Key Notes**
- **Unpublishing**: Avoid unpublishing (npm restricts this after 72 hours). Use `npm unpublish --force` only if critical.
- **Private Packages**: Use `"private": true` in `package.json` or pay for private hosting.
- **`.npmignore`**: Exclude files (like `node_modules/`, `test/`) by creating this file (works like `.gitignore`).

---

### **Example Workflow**
```bash
# After changes:
npm version patch
npm publish
```

---

### **Troubleshooting**
- **Name Conflicts**: Change `name` in `package.json` if the name is taken.
- **Permissions**: Ensure youâ€™re logged in (`npm whoami`).
